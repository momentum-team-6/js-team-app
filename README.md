# Team-Coding: Movie Watching List App

Today we shall "mob code" a single-page application for listing movies or shows you want to watch. "Mob programming" is a strategy for writing code with multiple contributors -- a little like pair programming, but you have more than two people.

The app you are building is similar to your note-taking app or the todo app we made in class. You'll use live-server for the front-end and json-server to store data.

A user should be able to enter a new movie, see a list of all their movies, and edit existing movie entries. Editing should include changing movie titles and marking movies as watched.

Movies have a title, a boolean indicating whether it has been watched or not, a human-readable date created, and, if marked as watched, a human-readable date that it was marked as watched. These dates should not be user-editable but set programmatically when a movie is saved or edited.

CSS is not important in this project, but you can add minimal styling as needed. Basic styling is being provided with [PicnicCSS](https://picnicss.com/), and a `style.css` is included in the repo.

**You won't be able to do all of this** so make some decisions about where to start and what to do later.

## Product Roadmap and Requirements

- Clone the repo and run `npm install`.
- Copy the `sample-db.json` to `db.json`.
- Run `npm start` to run live-server and json-server together (just like you did for the notes app).
- Create a form to allow a user to add a new movie. New movies are by default marked as not watched when they are added.
- Show a list of existing movies with watched or not watched indicated somehow. Watched movies should show the date they were watched.
- Allow a user to mark a movie as having been watched.
- BONUS FEATURE: display the movie list sorted in alphabetical order.

## Mob programming rules

Each person must _verbally_ contribute to the code being written, but only one person at a time is typing. As always, our discussion will be guided by our respect for each other and our agreement from day one to protect our safe learning space.

**The Goal**: Finish this app during class time today (morning and afternoon).

We will switch roles every 10 minutes.

Some things to keep in mind:

- **It's 100% ok to be wrong about something.**
- **It's 100% ok not to know something.**
- **Try things even if you are not sure they are right.**
- **Move swiftly and be decisive even if you are uncertain.**
- **Run code in the console.**
- **Use `console.log` and `debugger`**
- **Just jump in and throw out some ideas!**

### The roles

**The Driver** This person shares their screen and does the typing. In this role, you are mainly a conduit for the ideas of the group, implementing what the Navigator asks you to. You are not generating code yourself.

**The Navigator** The navigator leads the way, making decisions based on the input of the group about what to do and giving direction about what to type to the driver. They may ask the scout and individual contributors for help as needed.

**The Moderator** The job of the moderator is to keep everyone focused and on track and be sure all voices are heard. This person leads the discussion, asks pertinent questions to generate ideas, and keeps things moving forward in cooperation with the Navigator.

**The Scout** This person is responsible for looking up syntax or documentation and may be asked to do that by anyone on the team. They may also make suggestions for things to try if they come across relevant examples in the documentation.

**The Individual Contributors** These developers make suggestions and offer helpful advice as needed. The traffic controller may ask them directly for their input and moderate their contributions to the discussion.

### Role assignments

We'll shift roles at 10-minute intervals. Each person will have a chance to occupy every role. When we reach the last shift, we will start over and repeat the cycle.

If anyone needs to take a break or step away, their role can be filled by one of the Individual Contributors for that round.

At the beginning of each shift, pull down all the code from the repo. The driver should share their screen (or live share in vs code).

At the end of each shift, add, commit, and push all the code that has been written.
